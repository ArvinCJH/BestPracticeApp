     * README.txt for version 8.1 of Vim: Vi IMproved.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * WHAT IS VIM?
     * <p>
     * Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
     * features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
     * history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
     * script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
     * available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi "in the
     * fingers" will feel at home.  See "runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt" for differences with
     * Vi.
     * <p>
     * This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
     * All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
     * with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
     * mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.
     * <p>
     * Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
     * almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
     * difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
     * DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * DISTRIBUTION
     * <p>
     * You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
     * Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
     * if you want more features.
     * <p>
     * There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
     * This README.txt file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
     * documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
     * Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
     * Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
     * want or must compile it yourself.  Check "http://www.vim.org/download.php" for
     * an overview of currently available distributions.
     * <p>
     * Some popular places to get the latest Vim:
     * * Check out the git repository from github: https://github.com/vim/vim.
     * * Get the source code as an archive: https://github.com/vim/vim/releases.
     * * Get a Windows executable from the vim-win32-installer repository:
     * https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * COMPILING
     * <p>
     * If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
     * obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
     * "src" directory.  See src/INSTALL for instructions.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * INSTALLATION
     * <p>
     * See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
     * READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
     * archive):
     * <p>
     * README_ami.txt		Amiga
     * README_unix.txt		Unix
     * README_dos.txt		MS-DOS and MS-Windows
     * README_mac.txt		Macintosh
     * README_vms.txt		VMS
     * <p>
     * There are more README_*.txt files, depending on the distribution you used.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * DOCUMENTATION
     * <p>
     * The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
     * started as "vimtutor".  See ":help tutor" for more information.
     * <p>
     * The best is to use ":help" in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
     * "runtime/doc/help.txt".  It contains pointers to the other documentation
     * files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
     * Vim.  See ":help user-manual".
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * COPYING
     * <p>
     * Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
     * encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
     * "runtime/doc/uganda.txt" for details (do ":help uganda" inside Vim).
     * <p>
     * Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
     * unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
     * text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
     * The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
     * distribute it.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * SPONSORING
     * <p>
     * Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
     * your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
     * working on Vim please send a donation.
     * <p>
     * Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
     * in Uganda.  See runtime/doc/uganda.txt.  But at the same time donations
     * increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!
